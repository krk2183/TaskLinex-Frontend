# 🎯 TaskLinex

## ☕ Platform designed for your team

**TaskLinex** is a focus-first productivity system designed to reduce cognitive overload by surfacing only what matters now and what comes next.
By putting teams first, Tasklinex reimagines communications and reduces time wasted on meetings. 

It is not a notes app, a document wiki, or a workspace clone. It is a tool for **execution**.

## 🧠 Core Philosophy
> **Clarity before complexity. Execution before organization.**

Most productivity tools fail because they optimize for *storage*, not *action*. TaskLinex is built around the **Pulse**, a central interface designed to answer three questions at a glance:
1. **What am I working on right now?**
2. **How far along am I?**
3. **What should I do next?**

---

## ⚡ Pulse (The Core Interface)
Pulse is the main interaction surface—intentionally minimal and distraction-free.

* **Current Focus:** A glanceable view of your active task with a visual progress indicator (0–100%).
* **Up Next:** The immediate next task with a short rationale explaining *why* it’s next.
* **Minimalist Design:** If it does not help you execute the current task, it does not belong here.

## 📂 Structure
Each page is designed to specialize in one responsibility only.

| Page | Status | Responsibility |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Pulse (Home)** | ✅ Visually Complete | Execution-focused overview and active task management. |
| **Roadmap** | ✅ Visually Complete | Broader task and project overview. |
| **Analytics** | 📅 Planned | Performance insights and progress patterns (no vanity metrics). |
| **Settings** | 📅 Planned | User preferences and configuration. |

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
The project focuses on UI correctness and structure before introducing backend complexity.

* **Frontend:** [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router), React, [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
* **State:** Component-driven UI with mocked data variables
* **Backend (Planned):** FastAPI with AI-assisted prioritization logic

---

## ✨ Design Principles
* **Focus > Flexibility:** Fewer decisions, clearer defaults.
* **One Primary Task:** Designed to eliminate context switching.
* **Visual Feedback:** Visual progress indicators over raw data tables.
* **Static First:** Establishing solid foundations before adding adaptive logic.

## 🚫 Non-Goals
TaskLinex is intentionally opinionated and does **not** aim to:
* Replace Notion or become a document/wiki system.
* Support infinite customization at the cost of clarity.
* Optimize for aesthetic "vanity" dashboards over execution.
